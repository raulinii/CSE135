Analysis of 3rd Party Analytics: I opted to using Smartlook because I really enjoyed the UI/recording aspect of Logrocket. I wanted a 3rd party service that had similar features to Logrocket (recordings), but also a service that introduced other features I didn't see inside of Logrocket. Upon researching Smartlook I saw they had recordings as well as heatmaps which ultimately led to me setting it up for my website. After putting the script in my .html pages I browsed through the features which led to me looking at the "Rage Click" feature. This feature tracks when a user continuosly clicks on the webpage, whether its on a link or a static part of the page. After "rage clicking" on my webpage I saw that Smartlook tracked the event and logged it on my dashboard.
